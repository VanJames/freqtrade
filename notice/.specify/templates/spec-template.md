# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`

**Created**: [DATE]

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?
- What happens when CoinGlass page scraping, CCXT, or SMTP dependencies time out
  or return malformed data?
- What happens when CoinGlass page selectors, screenshot regions, or coordinate
  mappings no longer match the live page?
- How does the system reject scraped liquidation prices that are outside
  configured sanity bounds around current market price?
- How does the system behave when required environment variables are missing?
- How does the state machine report "no trade/no notice" when evidence is
  insufficient or conflicting?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Governance Requirements *(mandatory for trading notice features)*

- **GR-001**: Features that use liquidation heatmap data MUST source it through
  Playwright-based scraping of the CoinGlass free web page, not the official
  CoinGlass API.
- **GR-002**: Features that use K-line data MUST source it through CCXT.
- **GR-003**: Features that send email MUST use Python's built-in `smtplib` and
  `email.mime`.
- **GR-004**: Trading decisions MUST be explainable rule/state-machine outcomes
  with observable evidence.
- **GR-005**: External dependency interactions MUST define exception handling,
  bounded retry behavior, failure backoff where relevant, and user-visible or
  test-visible failure states.
- **GR-006**: API keys, SMTP credentials, exchange credentials, and tokens MUST
  be read from environment variables or an approved secret boundary.
- **GR-007**: The liquidation extractor, K-line analyzer, and decision/email
  driver MUST remain independently unit testable when changed.
- **GR-008**: CoinGlass scraping MUST use versioned selector/coordinate mapping
  configuration and fail closed on page layout or mapping mismatch.
- **GR-009**: Scraped liquidation prices MUST pass sanity validation against
  current market price and configured range bounds before entering decisions.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]

## Assumptions

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right assumptions based on reasonable defaults
  chosen when the feature description did not specify certain details.
-->

- [Assumption about target users, e.g., "Users have stable internet connectivity"]
- [Assumption about scope boundaries, e.g., "Mobile support is out of scope for v1"]
- [Assumption about data/environment, e.g., "Existing authentication system will be reused"]
- [Dependency on existing system/service, e.g., "Requires access to the existing user profile API"]
